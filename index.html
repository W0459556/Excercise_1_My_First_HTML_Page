    <h2><center>What do you think web design and development is about?</center></h2>
    <p><center>I think, as a class, web design/development should be about learning<br />HTML, CSS, and how to impliment JS into web pages at a beginner level.</center></p>
    <br />

    <h2><center>What are your thoughts on planet-centric design and<br />your initial thoughts on the user experience of design?</center></h2>
    <p><center>My thoughts are that such topics should be reserved for later on in our learning<br />journey; we should be focusing far more on the basics of web design<br />before we delve deeper into any given topic.</center></p>
    <br />

    <h2><center>How important do you think web design and<br />development is in today's digital world?</center></h2>
    <p><center>I think web design and development are immensely important in the modern age;<br />everything we do, we do with computers; having clean, easy to understand, and<br />attractive user interfaces is a must for any and all digital application.</center></p>
    <br />

    <h2><center><i>Excitement to Learn:</i> What aspects of web design<br />and development are you excited to learn about?</center></h2>
    <p><center>I enjoy back-end development with JavaScript, Hamlet is proving to be an<br />excellent teacher and the subject matter he coveres using JavaScript is very interesting.<br />I hope to continue to learn more JavaScript and use it in a web development setting.</center></p>
    <br />

    <h2><center><i>Mastering a Skill:</i> Think about your goals in this field.</center></h2>
    <h3><center>If you could master one specific skill in web design and development, what<br />would it be? (e.g., front-end development, UX design, back-end development, etc.)</center></h3>
    <p><center>Assuming that back-end development heavily involves JavaScript, that would be my first choice.</center></p>
    <h3><center>Why did you choose that skill? What interests you about it?</center></h3>
    <p><center>it reminds me of the first programming language I learned while I was still in highschool- Python.<br>My Computer Programming 12 teacher, Mr. Crane, was one of my favourite teachers<br />through all of my years of schooling.</center></p>
    <br />

    <h2><center>Future Plans:</center></h2>
    <h3><center>How do you envision using web design and development<br />skills in your future career or personal projects?</center></h3>
    <p><center>I plan to utelise my knowledge of front and back-end web development in tandem<br />with my pre-existing knowledge of business, having graduated from the<br />NSCC Business Administration - Accounting program proior to starting this program, to<br />create web programs akin to BlackLine that will aide in the Accounting process for those working in<br />Accounts Recievable/Payable positons</center></p>
